**Making changes to the docs**

Please, be aware that most of `.md` files in this repo are auto generated
from files in the [main repo](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/docs).
Any changes to docs in the main repo are automatically copied to this repo.
We do this to keep the docs as close as possible to the product.

If you spot a typo or want to apply other change to docs please consider
creating a PR against [docs source](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/docs)
instead.
